Chapter 1: Cytoplasmic Membrane and Cell Wall
In this chapter, I learned about the structural differences between the cytoplasmic membrane and cell wall in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. 
The role of the cytoplasmic membrane as a selective barrier for substances and how the cell wall provides structural support and protection to the cell was emphasized. 
Understanding the types of cell wall structures in bacteria, including peptidoglycan, helped me better grasp how microorganisms can be classified. 
This knowledge will be important when considering drug development and the resistance mechanisms that involve the cell wall.
