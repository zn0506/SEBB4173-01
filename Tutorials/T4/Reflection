Chapter 4: DNA Translation
Translation describes how the mRNA, which is transcribed from DNA, is utilized to construct proteins in the ribosomes. 
Grasping the translation process, along with the functions of tRNA and rRNA, enhanced my understanding of how cells convert genetic information into functional proteins. 
The idea of codons and the genetic code deepened my appreciation for the variety of proteins produced within cells. 
Discovering how translation can be regulated also highlighted the intricacies of gene expression and protein synthesis, both of which are essential for cell functions and the development of organisms.
