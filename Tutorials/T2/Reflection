Chapter 2: DNA Replication
This chapter helped me deepen my understanding of DNA replication, which is essential for cell division. 
The enzymes involved, like DNA polymerase, helicase, and ligase, along with the formation of the replication fork, provided a clear picture of how genetic information is duplicated accurately. 
The concept of semi-conservative replication also clarified how one strand of the parent DNA is conserved in each of the daughter strands. 
This reinforced my understanding of cellular processes and their significance in maintaining genetic integrity.
