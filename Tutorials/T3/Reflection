Chapter 3: DNA Transcription
Learning about transcription in this chapter made me realize the complexity of gene expression. 
I found it interesting how the cell translates a segment of DNA into RNA, which is the first step in the process of protein synthesis. 
The roles of RNA polymerase and transcription factors in synthesizing mRNA from a DNA template were fascinating. 
I also gained a deeper appreciation for the significance of promoters and terminators in regulating gene expression, which is key to cellular function and adaptation.
